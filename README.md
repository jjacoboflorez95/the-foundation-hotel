# 🏨 The Foundation Hotel - Website Project

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Foundation Hotel** website is designed to showcase the hotel’s services, rooms, events, and contact information through a visually appealing and responsive layout. This project was developed as a **final group project** in college, with a key requirement that all CSS styles be contained in a single file to ensure design consistency.

As part of this project, my primary contribution was the **About Us** page, which presents the history of the hotel, its staff, and its services.
